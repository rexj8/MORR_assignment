### How did you decide on the technical and architectural choices used as part of your solution?
    As React is one of the most versatile Front End Language that is capable of doing anything and the biggest 
    part is it's speed of loading components in browser.
     
    Use of these particular components is to make our code more readable and it will take less time in future 
    to add more features in this web app because all components are already arranged in well defined folders 
    that helps to uderstand the working of components. I had a thought of developing this Web App that how to
    link all the components I have used in this. How to fetch data from give JSON by using of axios and using 
    of loading and error handling in the same. Differnt Screens, filtering data, linking differnet screens 
    with react routers and many more. These all components and routings are fullfilling the need that has 
    mentioned in the assignment. 


### Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
    By discussing and brainstorming we will definitely do improvements beacause there is always a scope of 
    improvement.

### What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?
    1. Create a user Login System
    2. Will Push Notification to the users
    3. Will Add a Recomendation System for latest and most watched movies or series.
    4. Will Provide a small video streaming window for streaming online and I will 
       store movies and series on google drive.
